# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve daily programming puzzles to improve their coding skills and have fun. Each day from December 1st to December 24th, a new puzzle is released, and this project documents my approach and solutions to these puzzles.
During this years event, I reallized that I want to test FastAPI. So the solutions are implemented as FastAPI endpoints.
There is also a frontend available to interact with the API.
> **Note**: This project is a work in progress, and I will be updated once new solutions are available.

## Structure

- **days**: Contains the solutions for each day's challenge.
- **inputs**: Contains the input data for each day's challenge.
- **media**: Contains media files used in the project.
- **main.py**: Main FastAPI application file.
- **index.html**: Frontend to interact with the API.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies for the project.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, navigate to the respective day's folder and execute the Python script:

```bash
cd days
python day<number of day>.py
```
